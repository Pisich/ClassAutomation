# ClassAutomation
A new way of joining your online classes.

You can set up your class schedule when you first launch the program, you will enter at what time and day you will like to launch the different applications ClassAutomation is compatible with. You will only enter your schedule one time and ClassAutomation will do it for you the rest of the time.

I came up with this project idea when some teachers were giving their classes on different platforms, it was hard to keep on when there was no break between classes. That is when ClassAutomation comes in handy, after you have entered your class schedule the program will launch the proper conference application, without having to lose track of the subject of the class if you took a 2 minute break. We hope this tool helps students be on time in their online classes and help them keep track of which platform their next class is.
